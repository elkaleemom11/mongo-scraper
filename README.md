**NPR NEWS SCRAPER**

**Overview**

In this assignment, I created a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news hitting our nation today.  I became interested watching NPR news years ago when I was a grad student at Wayne State University, where the only reliable news I could pick up in the lab was NPR!  I was struck by the depth, focus, and attention of topics being discussed outside the scope of "everyday" news reporting.  The comprehensive coverage and reporting was unlike any other news station, so I was hooked, and remained a supporter and listener ever since!   

It is here I hope to create interest to viewers who want a reliable, reputable, and outstanding reporting as does NPR.   The articles I "scrape" will provide incredible stories about current topics of today. I used Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape NPR news articles.


**Dependencies**
A list of the following dependencies: 
express
express-handlebars
mongoose
body-parser
cheerio
request

I also deployed Heroku, and set-up mongo Lab (mLab), a remote MongoDB that supports Heroku natively. My app connects mongoose to my remote mongolab database when deployed, but will otherwise connect to the local mongoHeadlines database on my computer.
